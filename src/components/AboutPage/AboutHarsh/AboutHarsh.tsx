                        I’m a UX/UI designer living in Gujarat, India interested in how people and
                        software can work together to make life better. I'm currently a freelancer,
                        where I design experiences around finding and using better UX/UI for my
                        clients and Users.

                        My design expertise extends from crafting intuitive mobile
                        screens to seamless experiences on large computers. My journey
                        as a designer began in 2018 with hand sketches.

                        But it was in 2019 that I discovered the world of engineering
                        and UI/UX design. In 2020, I joined Marqtwinn with two important
                        persons of life my friends, where our dedication resulted in numerous
                        successful projects.

                        Despite facing challenges in 2022 when our account got hacked, I emerged stronger,
                        founding Burnerbuzz Firm and embarking on a 30-day, 30-full-design challenge to polish
                        my skills to perfection.

                        In 2023, my efforts started gaining recognition, and I began receiving

                        “As a designer, I enjoy being a generalist with a focus on craft and
                        prototyping. I value beautiful visuals backed by smart systems
                        thinking. I love the concept that a digital product is a living thing that
                        can adapt and evolve over time.”

                        Outside of design, I love food and Gym in all capacities. I spend my time
                        exploring new restaurants, cooking new dishes, and talking about my next meal.
                        I think a lot about the planes, horror stories, and my rabbit Chiku
                        (Yes, she was named after a fruit).
